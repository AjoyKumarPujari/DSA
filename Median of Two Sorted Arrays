Median of Two Sorted Arrays
arr1[]=1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12 arr2[]= 2, 3, 6, 15  
from array 1 : 1 3 4 | 7 10 12
from array 2 : 2 3   | 6 15 
sorting the 1st parts 1, 2, 3, 3, 4
sorting the 2nd parts 5, 7, 10, 12, 15
there is alwaya one symmetry 3 elements from arr1 and 2 elements from arr2
valid symmetry or not valid?? check element from the 1st part should be smaller then the 2nd part(cross gyes are check) 4, 6 and 3, 7
now calculate the mediun => we took greatest of 1st part and smallest of 2nd part and add them and divide by 2
